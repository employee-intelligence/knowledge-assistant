/**
 * Exercises the proxy over real HTTP rather than against a stub.
 *
 * The whole job here is moving headers — the browser's `Cookie` up, and every
 * `Set-Cookie` down with its `SameSite`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `Path` and `Max-Age`
 * intact — and those are exactly the details a mock would be written to agree
 * with. A stub that agreed with the implementation would pass while every real
 * deployment failed to sign in.
 *
 * One pair of servers for the whole file rather than one per test: `fetch` keeps
 * connections alive, so tearing a listener down between tests either waits on
 * them or leaves the next test racing a half-closed port.
