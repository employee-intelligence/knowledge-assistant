/**
 * Forwards `/api` to the backend, so the app and the API share one origin.
 *
 * This exists because of how browsers decide about cookies, and it is the whole
 * reason a session works at all.
 *
 * The session is two `httpOnly` cookies. Whether the browser attaches them to an
 * API call is decided by the *site* — the registrable domain — and not by the app.
 * With the API on its own host the call is cross-site, and each browser then
 * applies its own policy to it: Safari and Chrome block or partition third-party
 * cookies outright, and `SameSite=Lax` withholds the cookies from every `fetch`
 * that is not same-site. The failure looks identical from the app — the sign-in
 * request returns 200, and the very next call comes back 401 — and it appears and
 * disappears with the browser and the device rather than with anything in the
 * code. That is the "you signed in, but this browser did not keep the session"
 * report.
 *
 * Serving the API through this process makes every `/api` call same-origin, so the
 * cookies are first-party by construction: no `SameSite=None`, no third-party
 * cookie policy, and no dependence on how the host happens to be spelled. It also
 * means the cookie is host-only for whatever address the app was opened at, so
 * `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, a phone on the same wifi and the deployed domain all
 * behave identically instead of each needing their own cookie policy.
 *
 * Headers are forwarded rather than reconstructed, which is what keeps the session
 * working: the browser's `Cookie` goes up untouched, and every `Set-Cookie` the
 * backend answers with comes back untouched, including the `SameSite`, `Secure`,
 * `HttpOnly`, `Path` and `Max-Age` attributes that define the cookie's lifetime.
 * Rewriting any of them here is how a proxy silently breaks sign-in.

/** Builds the handler that forwards `prefix` to the backend.

 * mount, so forwarding that sends `/auth/login` to a backend that routes on
 * `/api/auth/login`, and every call 404s — which reads as the API being down rather
 * than as a path being lost in the proxy.
 *
 * `resolveOrigin` is called per request rather than once at startup, and that is
 * deliberate. The default deployment does not use this proxy at all — the browser
 * calls the backend directly, named in `config.json` — so reading `API_ORIGIN` at
 * startup meant a deployment with no proxy configured and no `API_ORIGIN` refused to
 * boot at all, taking the whole app down over a feature it was not using. Resolved
 * lazily, a missing value can only affect a request that actually needed it.
 *
