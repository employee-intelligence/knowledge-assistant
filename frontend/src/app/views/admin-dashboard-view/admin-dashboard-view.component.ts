/**
 * The administrator's landing screen.
 *
 * Two things, and only two: the figures an administrator is asked for, and what has
 * happened lately. The indexing breakdown, the knowledge-base health bar and the
 * recent-questions panel that used to live here were all derived from a placeholder
 * document list, so every one of them was a number with nothing behind it. They are
 * gone rather than reworded, because a real figure next to an invented one is worse
 * than the invented one alone — an administrator cannot tell which is which.
 *
 * Navigation is the sidebar's job. This screen used to carry a tab bar as well,
 * which meant two systems for one job and left the reader working out which was
 * the real one.
