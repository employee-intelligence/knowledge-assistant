 * and leaves this list alone, so the number of rows is the number of threads the
 * user has started rather than the number of questions they have asked.
 *
 * The administration links sit in the footer rather than above the conversations,
 * so an employee's sidebar and an administrator's differ only by what is below the
 * list: an employee who is not an administrator sees no administration section at
 * all, rather than one that is present and disabled.
