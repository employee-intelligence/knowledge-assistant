/**
 * The header strip every view sits under: the sidebar toggle and the view
 * title, centred.
 *
 * Below `lg` the sidebar is an overlay drawer, so the closed drawer cannot show
 * the product name. The header stands in for it there, with the toggle on the
 * trailing edge; from `lg` up the sidebar is on screen, so the header goes
 * back to a centred title with the toggle on the leading edge.
 *
 * Every one of those choices is made by a `lg` variant rather than by reading
 * the viewport in TypeScript, so the header is already correct on the first
 * paint. Switching the glyph from a menu to a panel once hydration caught up
 * meant phones briefly showed the wrong icon.
 *
 * The two glyphs each sit in a wrapper instead of carrying the visibility
 * utility themselves. `app-icon` sets `inline-flex` on its own host, and two
 * display utilities of equal weight are settled by stylesheet order, not by the
 * order they appear in the class attribute, so `hidden` on the host lost and
 * both icons drew at once. A wrapper with no display utility of its own is
 * hidden reliably.
 *
 * It owns no state of its own; the toggle delegates to `LayoutService`.
