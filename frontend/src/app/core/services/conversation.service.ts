 * - The messages of the open conversation are held here too, rather than being
 *   re-fetched per view, so switching to another conversation and back does not
 *   re-read a thread that is already in memory.
 *
 * A conversation is never expired, retired or swapped out from under the user.
 * Asking a follow-up extends the conversation it belongs to, and a conversation
 * keeps its id for as long as it exists, so `/response/:id` is a link that still
