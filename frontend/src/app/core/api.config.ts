/**
 * Single source for the backend origin. Every HTTP call is built from this
 * constant, so pointing the app at a different deployment is a one-line change.
 *
 * The backend serves CORS with a wildcard origin, so the browser calls it
 * directly and no dev-server proxy is involved.
 *
 * Paths are appended by `ApiService`, which builds them from this origin, so the
 * `/api` prefix that the routes live under is not part of it.
 *
 * THE HOST MUST MATCH THE ONE THE APP IS SERVED FROM, exactly.
 *
 * Not a style point. The session cookies are `SameSite=Lax`, and "site" is decided
 * by the host, so a page at `127.0.0.1:4201` calling `localhost:8099` is a
 * cross-site request and the browser will not attach the cookies to it — sign-in
 * then appears to succeed, the cookies are stored, and every subsequent call comes
 * back 401. The ports are irrelevant; `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are different
 * hosts and that is enough. The same applies in production, where it decides
 * whether the deployed frontend and the deployed API are one site or two.
 *
 * For local work, use `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost` on both sides: `ng serve`
 * only permits `127.0.0.1` by default, so a `localhost` page is refused with a 400
 * before any of this matters.
