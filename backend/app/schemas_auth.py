"""Request and response shapes for the auth layer.

The company email rule lives here rather than in the router, so it cannot drift
between the two routes that take an address. A validator is also the right place
for it: a non-company address is rejected as a 422 before any database lookup, any
bcrypt work, or any decision about whether the account exists.

Nothing in this module returns a password or a token. That is enforced by the
response models rather than by discipline at the call site, because the response
models are the only thing standing between a `User` row and a JSON body.
