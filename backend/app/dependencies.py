"""The request-scoped dependencies every route is built on.

`get_current_user` is the single place that decides who a request is from. It reads
one cookie and nothing else: no `Authorization` header, no token in the query
string. Accepting a token from more than one place would mean the "where could a
token leak from" question has two answers instead of one, and query strings in
particular end up in access logs and `Referer` headers.

`require_admin` is a second dependency rather than an `if` in each admin route, so
that "which routes are admin-only" is answered by reading the route signatures
instead of by grepping for a role comparison.
