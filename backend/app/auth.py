"""The auth routes.

The shape of the thing: an administrator invites somebody, the invitation arrives
as a link, the recipient sets a password, and from then on sign-in is a cookie.
There is no route here that creates an account without an invitation behind it, and
that is a property of the code rather than a promise — `bootstrap-admin` below is
the single exception and it can only ever create the first administrator.

Nothing in this module returns a token. Tokens go out as `httpOnly` cookies and
the JSON body carries the user and nothing else, so a token cannot be picked up by
frontend JavaScript, printed by a `console.log`, or read out of a devtools network
tab.
