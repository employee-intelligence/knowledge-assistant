"""Conversation identity and persistence, at the level of the HTTP contract.

A few things here cost data integrity when they go wrong, so they are pinned:

- One conversation is one row in the sidebar. `POST /api/conversations` is the
  only thing that creates one, and every later message sent with that id is
  appended to the same conversation. A second conversation appearing mid-thread
  is what files messages under the wrong entry in the sidebar.
- A message never creates a conversation. Posting to an id that does not exist
  (or is not yours) is a 404, never a silent new conversation.
- There is no expiry. Conversations are never dropped for getting old, because
  "recent" is about what the user did last, not about some TTL the client has
  to babysit.
- Only the conversation's owner can read, rename or delete it, and the owner is
  whoever the client says it is, so another client guessing an id gets a 404.

The app's own startup builds a LlamaIndex index over the policy documents, which
needs network access and an embedding key. `TestClient` is used without its
context manager so the lifespan never runs, and `state["assistant"]` is replaced
with a stub, so these tests are offline and need no key.
